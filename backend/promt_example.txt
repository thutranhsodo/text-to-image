A serene lake surrounded by mountains at sunset
A hyperrealistic portrait of a weathered sailor in his 60s, with deep-set blue eyes, a salt-and-pepper beard, and weathered skin. He wears a faded captainâ€™s hat and a thick wool sweater. Background: misty harbor at dawn with fishing boats barely visible. Gentle, thoughtful expression, soft natural lighting, shallow depth of field.
A vast desert landscape with towering sand dunes under a golden-orange sky. Atop the highest dune stands a cloaked figure facing the horizon. The dunes resemble frozen waves, soft shadows, warm ambient light. Silent, mystical atmosphere.
A cat in a room with hello board
A surreal cityscape combining M.C. Escher geometry with Kandinsky abstract shapes. Impossible perspectives transform into musical instruments. Color palette: deep blues, vibrant reds, golden yellows. Floating musical notes connecting structures.
